# OpenAlex4NodeXL
This is part of a string of collaborative projects with the [Social Media Research Foundation](https://www.smrfoundation.org/) to create open source data importing software which will be integrated with NodeXL,
the proprietary software used by the Foundation's researchers to undertake social network analysis.

The collaboration focuses on building software that programmatically accesses publicly available data via API calls and wrangles the data into a format that can be injested by NodeXL for scientific analysis.
